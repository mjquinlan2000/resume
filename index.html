              <td><b>Enbala Power Networks</b><i>- Senior Software Engineer</i><br/> I am currently working with a team of developers to deliver real-time power management to consumers and producers of electricity using Phoenix and Elixir. Leveraging
                the Erlang/OTP framework for distributed messaging to different parts of the system. Starting to work with RabbitMQ for distributed message processing to gather IoT data from electrical devices in the field.

              <td><b>SportsLabs</b><i>- Senior Software Engineer</i><br/>Worked in a full Rails/Angular stack on several teams of developers to manage and display college sports data such as pictures, news, videos, and live-streaming content across multiple
                websites/products. Working to provide relevant and high-availability content to a large audience of users on a daily basis.
                <br/>
                <br/> My main focus was building a CMS from the ground up that allows for our customers to edit their college sports data. The CMS interacts with a JSON API provided by our data services team. There is a Rails middleware with an AngularJS
                front-end that manages user accounts and decorates objects from the API with missing data. Elasticsearch is used in the CMS as a way to quickly filter through all data that is available through the API. The CMS also integrates with various
                third parties from Google Analytics for users to gain insight into their web products that we manage to Twitter/Instagram integration to manage social data related to sports, teams, events etc.
