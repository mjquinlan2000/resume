                  |  My main focus for the past year has been building a CMS from the ground up that allows for our customers to edit their college sports data. The CMS
                  |               interacts with a JSON API provided by our data services team. There is a Rails middleware with an AngularJS front end that manages user accounts and decorates objects from the API with missing data.
                  |               Elasticsearch is used in the CMS as a way to quickly fitler through all data that is available through the API. The CMS also integrates with various third parties from Google Analytics for users to gain insight
                  |               into their web products that we manage to Twitter/Instagram integration to manage social data related to sports, teams, events etc.

This allowed for us to better determine the patient financial responsability before health services were rendered, giving hospitals the ability to charge patients beforehand as opposed to billing after. Also gained experience using a PostgreSQL backend, the Drools decision making engine, and the JUnit testing framework.
